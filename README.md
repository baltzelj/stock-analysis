# stock-analysis
Module 2 challenge exercises.
This is my second challenge exercise.
## Screenshots
The [screenshots folder](https://github.com/baltzelj/stock-analysis/tree/main/Results%20Screenshots) contains the screenshots of my Worksheets in the Multiple_year_stock_data.xlsm Excel document.
## VBA Code
My [VBA code](https://github.com/baltzelj/stock-analysis/blob/main/stock_analysis_vba.bas) is written using a basic file. I did do some [experimental stuff](https://github.com/baltzelj/stock-analysis/blob/main/experimental_vba.bas) trying out some different functions I saw on YouTube, but this does the same thing as my main one (although I think it takes longer to complete...).
